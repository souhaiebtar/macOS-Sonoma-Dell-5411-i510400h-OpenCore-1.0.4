## About This EFI

This EFI is configured for the Dell Latitude 5411 running macOS Sonoma. It aims for a stable and functional Hackintosh experience.

## Change Bios Locked settings 

this part was based on the repo above, as search on the internet for missing part that are not explained enough

`git clone https://github.com/platomav/BIOSUtilities/`

pip install -r requirements.txt

` python .\main.py "..\dellbios5x11v1.34.exe" --output-dir "..\dell_extract" `

they file were extracted
they did extract files, as show in the title of open program, i did open '1 dellbios -- 1 System BIOS with BIOS Guard v1.34.0.bin', after that i searched for 'MSR Lock' (old name CFG Lock ðŸ˜¤, thanks to a reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hz2rtm/cfg_lockunlocking_alternative_method/?rdt=33632), 

![uefitool search for MSR](./Pictures/uefitool-search-forMSR.png)

i did right click on it, and Extract as is..., you will get the `.sct` file , at least in my case

![uefitool extract as is](./Pictures/uefitool-extractAsIs.png)

than you can proceed with ifrextractor `https://github.com/LongSoft/IFRExtractor-RS`

i did try to follow `https://github.com/MokkaSchnalle/macOS-Dell-5411-5511` but a lot has changed from then

basically i got this 

from line 28 we pick the Name "SaSetup" using VarStoreId: 0x16 from 17756 (we also get VarOffset: 0xF5)

using setup_var.efi version 0.3 (already included in EFI folder, under EFI\OC\Drivers)

### Step to run the commands

1. Boot of USbDrive (that have OpenCore of the Efi partition)
2. Open openshell.efi (from the showing element)
3. Type `FS0:` than `enter` key(you might need to change if your efi partition is another)
4. Run `cd EFI\OC\Drivers`
5. Change DVMT pre allocated from default (32M) to 0x2  (64M)
```Bash
setup_var.efi SaSetup:0xF5=0x2 
```
6. Disable MRS(CFG) Lock
```Bash
setup_var.efi CpuSetup:0x2B=0x0
```

## Installation
1.  **Create a macOS USB Installer:** Follow the [Dortania OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) to create your USB installer.
2.  **Clone this Repository:** `git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_REPO]` or download the ZIP.
3.  **Copy EFI Folder:** Copy the `EFI` folder from this repository to the EFI partition of your USB installer.
4.  **Generate SMBIOS:** Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a unique SMBIOS for your system (e.g., `MacBookPro15,2` or an appropriate model for your hardware). Update your `config.plist` (PlatformInfo > Generic) with these values. **This step is crucial for Apple services.**
5.  **BIOS Settings:** Configure your BIOS settings as per the [BIOS Settings](#bios-settings) section below.
6.  **Install macOS:** Boot from the USB drive and install macOS.
7.  **Post-Installation:** After installation, mount the EFI partition of your system drive and copy the `EFI` folder from your USB to it.

## BIOS Settings

*   Secure Boot: Off (Default: On)
*   SATA Mode: AHCI (Default: RAID) (Also includes NVMe drives! macOS will not see any drives when using RAID mode)
*   Intel SGX: Software Controlled or Off
*   Thunderbolt Configuration: No Security


## Post-Installation
-   Mount your system's EFI partition.
-   Copy the EFI folder from your USB stick (which you've configured and tested) to the EFI partition of your main drive.
-   Generate new SMBIOS information if you haven't already and update your `config.plist`.
-   Consider any other system-specific tweaks or configurations.

## Updating OpenCore and Kexts
1.  Download the latest version of OpenCorePkg from [Acidanthera's GitHub](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).
2.  Update the necessary files (`BOOTx64.efi`, `OpenCore.efi`, `Drivers`, etc.) in your `EFI/OC` folder.
3.  Download the latest versions of your kexts (Lilu, WhateverGreen, VirtualSMC, AppleALC, etc.) from their respective repositories (usually found on Acidanthera's GitHub or Dortania's kexts page).
4.  Replace the old kexts in your `EFI/OC/Kexts` folder.
5.  Review the OpenCore release notes and the `Sample.plist` for any new or changed settings in `config.plist` and update your `config.plist` accordingly. Using a tool like [OCAuxiliaryTools (OCAT)](https://github.com/ic005k/OCAuxiliaryTools) can help with this.
6.  **Always back up your working EFI before making changes.**
